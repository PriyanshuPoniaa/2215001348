# Average Calculator Microservice ðŸš€

## ðŸ“– Overview
This project is an **Express.js microservice** that fetches numbers from a third-party API based on the selected type (`p` for **Fibonacci**, `e` for **Even**, `r` for **Random**). It maintains a **sliding window of 10 unique numbers**, calculates their **average**, and replaces the oldest number if the limit is exceeded.

The frontend is built using **React.js**, allowing users to interact with the microservice through a simple UI.
